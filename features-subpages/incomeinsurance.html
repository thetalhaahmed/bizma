<h3>What is Business Income Insurance?</h3>
<p class="text">Business Income coverage helps replace income lost when a business is unable to operate due to a covered property loss such as damage from a fire, theft or wind.<br><br>

Best of all, business income coverage is already included in a Business Owner's Policy from The Hartford. And you can easily increase coverage to meet specific risks to your business income by choosing from a variety of optional business income coverages that can be added as endorsements to your existing Business Owner's Policy.</p>
